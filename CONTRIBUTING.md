# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to all the repositories managed by [@LJHarb](https://github.com/ljharb), which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

# How Can I Contribute?

There are lots of ways to get involved. Here are some suggestions of things we'd love some help with.

## Resolving existing issues

You can consider helping out with issues already requiring attention - look for a "help wanted" label.

## Reporting issues

If you run into problems in the project, you can report them by opening a new issue within the repository. Before filing an issue, please perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If there is an issue template available, please always fill it out in its entirety - the template is there for a reason.

### How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or a command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or Github projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Provide as much context as possible** in order to help others verify and ultimately fix the issue.

## Documentation

We are happy to welcome contributions from anyone willing to improve documentation by adding missing information or making it more consistent and coherent.

# Dev Environment

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), preferably with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

* [Fork the repo and clone your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

* Get all dependencies
  ```
  npm install
  ```
* Add the upstream source for being able to sync main project changes back into your fork. For example, to configure an upstream remote repository for a fork of https://github.com/ljharb/repo-report run:
  ```
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:ljharb/repo-report.git
  ```
* Run the tests and the build
  ```
  npm test
  ```
* Make and submit changes to the project source files following our [pull request submission workflow](#pull-requests)

# Style Guide / Coding conventions

### Pull requests

Create a new branch

```
git checkout -b issue1234
```

Commit the changes to your branch, including a coherent commit message that follows our [standards](#commit-messages)

```
git commit -a
```

Before sending the pull request, make sure your code is running on the latest available code by rebasing onto the upstream source

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Verify your changes. Tests that fail without your changes *must* be added.

```
npm test
# or
npm run tests-only
```

Push your changes

```
git push origin issue1234
```

Send the [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests), make requested changes, and get merged.

### Commit Messages

* Limit the first line of the commit message (message summary) to 72 characters or less.
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature") and imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...") when providing a description of what you did.
* If your PR addresses an issue, reference it in the body of the commit message.
* See the rest of the conventions [here](https://gist.github.com/ljharb/772b0334387a4bee89af24183114b3c7)

#### Commit message example
